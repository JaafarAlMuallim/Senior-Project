No reproduction or distribution without the prior written consent of McGraw-Hill Education.\\n3.7 Limiting Reactants\\nDetermining the Limiting Reactant\\n55\\nTo determine how much CO will be left over when the\\nreaction is complete, we must first calculate the amount of\\nCO that will react with all 8 moles of H2\\n:\\nThus, there will be 4 moles of CO consumed and 1 mole\\n(5 mol – 4 mol) left over.\\nSAMPLE PROBLEM\\nCopyright © McGraw-Hill Education.

Always specify the physical states of all reactants and products, because they help \\ndetermine the actual enthalpy changes. \\n[In the equation for the combustion of methane, for example, changing the liquid \\nwater product to water vapor changes the value of ΔH.]\\n 2. If we multiply both sides of a thermochemical equation by a factor n, then ΔH \\nmust also change by the same factor. \\nCopyright © McGraw-Hill Education. All rights reserved.
